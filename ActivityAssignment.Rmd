```

##Daily Step Tracking##

```{r load_data}
library(dplyr)
activity_data <- unzip("activity.zip", files="activity.csv")
activity_data <- read.csv(activity_data)
activity_data$date <- as.Date(activity_data$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
nas <- filter(activity_data, is.na(activity_data$steps))
na_days <- (unique(nas$date))
without_nas <- filter(activity_data, steps!="NA")
```

```{r steps_by_day}
by_day <- group_by(without_nas, date) 
steps_by_day <- summarise(by_day, total=sum(steps))
total_steps <- steps_by_day$total
hist(total_steps, xlab="steps per day", main="Range and frequency of steps per day")
```

```{r mean_steps}
mean(total_steps)
```

```{r median_steps}
median(total_steps)
```
The mean number of steps per day was **`r mean_steps`**, with a median of **`r median_steps`**.

```{r avgs_per_interval}
per_interval <- group_by(without_nas, interval)
steps_per_interval <- summarise(per_interval, avg_steps=mean(steps))
with(steps_per_interval, plot(interval, avg_steps, type="l", xlab="time of day from midnight to 24:00", ylab="average number of steps", main="Average steps by time of day"))
ordered <- arrange(steps_per_interval, desc(avg_steps))
most_active_interval <- ordered[1,1]
```

The most active interval of the day, on average is **`r most_active_interval`**.

##Missing Values##
```{r na_rows}
length(nas$steps)
```
For periods of time during the two-month data-collection window, the device used to record steps was inactive, resulting in periods of missing data. There were a total of **`r na_rows`** 5-minute measurement intervals in which data was not collected. 

If necessary, we can fill each of these unmonitored intervals with the average value for that same interal for the rest of the two-month monitoring period.

```{r fill_nas}

activity_no_nas <- activity_data
nas2 <- filter(activity_no_nas, is.na(activity_no_nas$steps))
interval_vector <- steps_per_interval$interval
steps_vector <- steps_per_interval$avg_steps
for(i in nas2$interval)
  {x <- which(interval_vector==i)
  y <- steps_vector[x]
  activity_no_nas[x,"steps"]<-y}
```

Now that the missing values have been compensated for, the total number of steps taken per day now looks as follows:

```{r steps_per_day_no_nas}
by_day_no_nas <- group_by(activity_no_nas, date) 
daily_steps_no_nas <- summarise(by_day_no_nas, total=sum(steps))
total_steps_no_nas <- daily_steps_no_nas$total
hist(total_steps_no_nas, xlab="steps per day", main="Steps per day with missing data accounted for")
```

```{r mean_steps_no_nas}
mean(total_steps_no_nas)
```

```{r median_steps_no_nas}
median(total_steps_no_nas)
```
If we also consider the mean and median of this adjusted data -- **mean = `r mean_steps_no_nas`** and **median = `r median_steps_no_nas`** -- we see that adjusting for the missing data results in a small but notable change.

##Weekdays vs. Weekends##

The collected data shows a notable difference in step counts between weekdays and weekends.

```{r weekdays}
activity_no_nas <- mutate(activity_no_nas, weekdys = weekdays(date))
activity_no_nas[, "weekdys"] <- ifelse(activity_no_nas[, "weekdys"]=="Saturday" | activity_no_nas[, "weekdys"]=="Sunday", "weekend","weekday")

library(ggplot2)
qplot(interval, steps, data=activity_no_nas, facets=weekdys~., geom='line',
      main="Comparing weekend to weekday step numbers", ylab="number of steps")

activity_no_nas_by_weekdy <- group_by(activity_no_nas, weekdys)
activity_no_nas_by_weekdy <- summarise(activity_no_nas_by_weekdy, avg=mean(steps))
with(activity_no_nas, plot(interval, ))
```





This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
